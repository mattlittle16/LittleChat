## 🏗️ Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    Browser -->|HTTPS / WSS| NPM[Nginx Proxy Manager]
    NPM -->|HTTP| nginx[nginx reverse proxy]
    nginx -->|REST + WebSocket| Backend[ASP.NET Core API]
    nginx -->|Static files| Frontend[React SPA]
    Backend -->|SQL| DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    Backend -->|Pub/Sub| Valkey[(Valkey)]
    Backend -->|OIDC| Authentik[Authentik IdP]
```

The backend is a **modular monolith** — nine vertical modules deployed as a single unit with compile-time isolation enforced by architecture tests. Cross-module communication uses two patterns:

- **Shared interfaces** (`IPresenceService`, `IRealtimeNotifier`, `IUserLookupService` …) — for direct cross-module calls via DI, without exposing internal implementations
- **Integration events** (`MessageSentIntegrationEvent`, `UserFirstLoginIntegrationEvent` …) — for decoupled notifications via an in-memory event bus

Neither pattern creates a hard dependency on another module's internals, keeping each module independently extractable if scaling ever demands it.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | C# / .NET 8, ASP.NET Core, MediatR 12.x |
| **Real-time** | ASP.NET Core SignalR + Valkey (Redis-compatible) backplane |

| **Frontend** | React 19, TypeScript 5.9, Vite 7 |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui (slate theme) |
| **State** | Zustand v5 |
| **Editor** | Tiptap (inline markdown compose box) |
| **Auth** | OIDC → JWT Bearer tokens |
| **Image processing** | SixLabors.ImageSharp (resize, HEIC/HEIF support) |
| **Drag & drop** | @dnd-kit (topic sidebar reordering) |
| **Virtualisation** | — (cursor-based pagination bounds DOM size) |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker Compose, nginx, Nginx Proxy Manager |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions → self-hosted runner |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [.NET SDK 8.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) *(backend development only)*
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/) *(frontend development only)*
- An OIDC-compliant identity provider (e.g. Authentik, Keycloak, Auth0)

### 1. Configure your environment

```bash
git clone <repo-url> little-chat
cd little-chat
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values — see `.env.example` for all available options with inline documentation.

### 2. Configure your identity provider

Create an **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** application in your identity provider:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Client type | Confidential |
| Redirect URI | `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` |

Paste the generated Client ID, Client Secret, and Authority URL into your `.env`.

### 3. Run it

```bash
docker compose up
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| App | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend API | http://localhost:5000 |
| SignalR Hub | ws://localhost:5000/hubs/chat |

Both the backend (`dotnet watch`) and frontend (Vite) support hot reload — file changes reflect immediately.

### 4. Run the tests

```bash
# Backend (unit + architecture tests)
cd src/backend
dotnet test

# Frontend (unit tests + lint)
cd src/frontend
npm test && npm run lint
```

## 🌐 Production Deployment

Deployment is fully automated via GitHub Actions on every push to `master`.

**Server prerequisites:**
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner
- Nginx Proxy Manager (or equivalent) for TLS termination
- A shared Docker network named `app-network`

```bash
# One-time server setup
docker network create app-network
```

Configure **GitHub Secrets** for every variable listed in `.env.example` — the CI workflow assembles the `.env` at deploy time. Secrets are never stored on disk between deployments.

### Optional: Analytics & head scripts

The frontend `index.html` contains a `<!-- HEADSCRIPTS -->` placeholder that is replaced at build time. You can inject any `<script>` or `<link>` tags (e.g. an analytics snippet) by setting a **GitHub Actions variable** (not a secret) named `HEADSCRIPTS` on your repository:

> **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables → New repository variable**
> Name: `HEADSCRIPTS`
> Value: your script tags, e.g. `<script defer src="..."></script>`

If `HEADSCRIPTS` is not set the placeholder is simply removed and the app works with no analytics.

> **Note:** Enable WebSocket proxying on your NPM proxy host for the backend — required for SignalR connections.

## 💡 Design Decisions

A few intentional choices worth understanding:

- **Persist-before-broadcast** — messages are written to the database before being broadcast. No phantom messages.
- **Modular monolith** — modules deploy together but are architecturally isolated; boundaries are enforced by automated architecture tests.
- **Hard deletes only** — no soft deletes anywhere in the codebase.
- **30-day message TTL** — messages are hard-deleted after 30 days by a background cleanup service.
- **JWT in localStorage** — an accepted tradeoff to support the offline-first IndexedDB outbox.
- **DMs excluded from search** — global search covers public rooms only.
- **System messages use `user_id = NULL`** — ban notices and system events are stored as regular messages but excluded from unread counts and notifications. The sender name is persisted so it survives page reloads.
- **Admin audit log** — all admin actions (bans, unbans, member changes, topic create/delete) are recorded with timestamp, actor, and target.
- **Token blocklist in Valkey** — banned users have their JWT invalidated immediately via a Redis-backed blocklist; they cannot reconnect until the ban expires.
- **Blocklist fail-safe** — a 30-second in-memory fallback cache ensures recently-banned users stay blocked even during a Valkey outage.
- **Rate limiting** — sliding-window rate limits protect all message, search, and room-creation endpoints. Limits are configurable via `appsettings.json` under `RateLimit`.
- **Magic byte validation** — uploaded files are validated against their declared extension using header magic bytes, preventing MIME-type spoofing.
- **Health checks** — `/health` and `/ready` endpoints report PostgreSQL and Valkey connectivity for container orchestration and load balancer use.
